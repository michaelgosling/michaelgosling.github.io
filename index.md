Hey there!

My name is Michael Gosling, and I've been developing software profesionally since May 2019. I graduated from Nova Scotia Community College in 2019 with a diploma in IT Programming and have worked on various web products and services.

On this site you'll find a blog where I post about my hobby work as well as some links to my socials and previous work.
